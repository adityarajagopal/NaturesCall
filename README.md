#Nature's Call 

**this is not an individual project and was developed in collaboration with coders and animators part of Imperial College Game Developement Society** 

The plot of the original game was to have a main villian who clogged up all the toilets in a city and the main character (a janitor) needs to run through the levels to unclog all these toilets. 

The scripts above are for the first "sewer" level of the game where the character is running through a sewer. The entire game with all the unity assets can be found at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xrjens1pmdtdesi/AAD8P6OhcCgQE05TAoc4zXwma?dl=0 to download and build on unity. 

The levels were made by splitting up the level into 15 blocks and randomising the order in which these blocks appear each time the game is restarted. This means consecutive runs of the game are not identical. 

The controls for the game are: 

Up arrow - jump 

Down arrow - slide 

Right arrow - speed up 

Left arrow - slow down 

s - attack 

a - grab onto ropes, wheels etc. 

This is my first attempt to build a unity 2D game so please excuse any glitches/wierdness of the gameplay :) Enjoy!
